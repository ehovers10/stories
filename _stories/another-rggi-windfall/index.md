In their mid-September carbon emissions credit auction, RGGI netted $152 million for energy efficiency programs! [The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative](http://www.rggi.org/) (RGGI) is a joint effort among nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

RGGI is a cap-and-trade program in which the states set a CO<sub>2</sub> emissions allowance, and shares of that allowance are acquired by energy producers in quarterly auctions. As a result, the states can control the overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the region, and the market determines the cost of those emissions. Over the life of the program (started in 2008), auctions have brought in $2.2 billion.

The proceeds from RGGI auctions are earmarked for projects in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and consumer benefit programs. [EmPower New York](http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Programs/EmPower-New-York) has used RGGI funds to provide no-cost energy efficiency solutions to income-eligible New Yorkers, completing more than 100,000 projects and eliminating 4.1 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.

CO2 producers in RGGI states are required to hold allowances equal to their emissions measured over a control period. They can also help balance their emissions budget by offsetting their impact. Greenhouse gas offsetting projects can involve reduction or sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>2</sub>), or sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>2</sub>). But these projects aren't a way around emissions limits. Producers can offest only 3.3% of their emissions allowance. This forces them to stay within their emissions budget.

It addresses the real issue of limiting the amount of carbon we pump into the air. And it does so in a way that supports economic ingenuity. It accomplishes all this while supporting advancements in renewable energy development, and taking some of the burden off of individual residents of the Northeast.
