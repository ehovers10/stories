As an attempt to advance the debate on the relative merits of recycling over traditional waste disposal, [John Tierney's recent oped piece in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/the-reign-of-recycling.html?_r=0) is a pretty poor effort. Effective discussion of complex social issues requires the parties involved to respect the intelligence of their opponents, and Tierney seems to have a very low opinion of the practical reasoning skills of recycling advocates. 

He posits that recycling "is less an ethical activity than a religious ritual, like the ones performed by Catholics to obtain indulgences for their sins. Religious rituals don’t need any practical justification for the believers who perform them voluntarily." His implication is that eco-conscious people are either incapable of or uninterested in judging the real impact of their actions.

Tierney is wrong to suggest that cost-benefit analysis is overlooked in recycling advocacy. Of course, we can and ought to question the effectiveness of particular recycling practices, but we don't accomplish anything by blithely disparaging the motivations of the eco-conscious. If Tierney genuinely thinks that "recycling has been relentlessly promoted as a goal in and of itself" and "as a result, otherwise well-informed and educated people have no idea of the relative costs and benefits," then he needs to do some better research.

In her response to Tierney at NERC, Athena Lee Bradley does just that. Her article represents quality research and a genuine interest in sussing out the costs and benefits of recycling. She cites a number of valuable sources to provide context where Tierney offers merely bald claims. As an added bonus, she takes Tierney to task on his own research practices.

## Recycling defenders unite!

As an attempt to advance the debate on the relative merits of recycling over traditional waste disposal, [John Tierney's recent op-ed piece in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/the-reign-of-recycling.html?_r=0) is a pretty poor effort. Effective discussion of complex social issues requires the parties involved to respect the intelligence of their opponents, and Tierney seems to have a very low opinion of the practical reasoning skills of recycling advocates. 

He posits that recycling "is less an ethical activity than a religious ritual, like the ones performed by Catholics to obtain indulgences for their sins. Religious rituals don’t need any practical justification for the believers who perform them voluntarily." His implication is that eco-conscious people are either incapable of or uninterested in judging the real impact of their actions.

Tierney also challenges the motivations of politicians in promoting recycling efforts, claiming that "to many public officials, recycling is a question of morality, not cost-benefit analysis. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York declared that by 2030 the city would no longer send any garbage to landfills. 'This is the way of the future if we’re going to save our earth,' he explained." Notice that Mayor de Blasio explicitly references the goal of saving the Earth. This reference to practical concerns is cost-benefit analysis 101. Tierney has cherry-picked a quote that doesn't even serve his own interests.

Tierney is wrong to suggest that cost-benefit analysis is overlooked in recycling advocacy. Of course, we can and ought to question the effectiveness of particular recycling practices, but we don't accomplish anything by blithely disparaging the motivations of the eco-conscious. Rather than speculate on motivations, we can examine actual considerations about recycling, good and bad.  For instance,

+ The [EPA offers a fact-sheet](http://www3.epa.gov/lmop/basic-info/) on the dangers of methane gas produced in landfills that challenges Tierney's claim that landfills are lovely resources to maintain.
+ The suggestion that landfill methane is an easily utilized energy source is also worth questioning, as they do at [Energy Justice](http://www.energyjustice.net/lfg).
+ [Smithsonian Magazine](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/recycling-you-may-be-doing-it-wrong-180951192/?no-ist) recognizes that recycling does take more care than simply tossing items, and they provide a list of tips on how to go about it.
+ The folks at [Resource Recycling](http://resource-recycling.com/node/6494) have compiled a few different links and reposted an op-ed from Patty Moore (who Tierney references, but doesn't respond to) about some of the issues with sorting recyclables at processing centers.

These discussions about the specific costs and benefits of recycling (or failing to do so) are invaluable to the discussion. But I'd like to focus on a theme I saw in Tierney's piece that that I think often creeps up in challenges to the cost effectiveness of various environmental policies. It is the same issue that has [hounded the electric car](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/electric-cars-green) for many years. I think that it is a general problem we face in applying cost-benefit reasoning -- the challenge of separating something's true value from its merely incidental consequences.

Let's assume for the sake of argument that we all share the goal of reducing the amount of carbon humans inject into the environment. The concern is only with whether recycling actually serves to further that goal.

The first rule of quantitative reasoning is [don't forget about the baselines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy). In assessing the relative costs of a social practice, it is important to remember that every such practice takes place within a network of interrelated practices. To assess the true value of a specific practice, we must determine which effects are central to it and which are due to the broader environment. (Similar motivations are present in the [WOWY methodology](http://www.hardballtimes.com/two-dimensions-of-catching/) in advanced baseball analysis. Go Mets!) The idea is that we want to assess the practice *itself*. Without this sort of corrective consideration, we risk treating viable practices as guilty by association,  thereby throwing the baby out with the bath water. (You should probably be [recycling your bath water](http://greywateraction.org/contentabout-greywater-reuse/) anyway.)

As an example, Tierney points out that in preparing recyclables for processing (he focuses on rinsing out yogurt tubs using warm water, but we could include other efforts, such as sorting recyclables), we use a number of resources, and many of these resources involve a carbon cost. Perhaps, Tierney surmises, "if you wash plastic in water that was heated by coal-derived electricity, then the net effect of your recycling could be more carbon in the atmosphere."

This may well be true, and if so, it's a problem. But Tierney draws the exact wrong conclusion from it. This is not a challenge for the practice of recycling: it is an issue that stems from the system within which our recycling practice is embedded. The problem is that we still power so much of our daily activites with fossil fuels. Find other ways to heat your water, and keep on recycling.

In a similar vein, Tierney offers the statistic that a single round-trip flight from New York to London is carbon-equivalent to 40,000 recycled plastic bottles. Again, the conclusion should not be that recycling plastic isn't worth much; it should be that trans-Atlantic flight is incredibly costly to the environment. If we're concerned about our carbon footprint, we ought to both recycle *and* eliminate unnecessary air travel.

Recycling isn't going to solve the world's environmental woes on its own. But no one genuinely thinks that as long as they recycle they get a free ride to perform any actions they wish. Environmental advocates need to have a wide portfolio of interests. Carbon creation is deeply embedded in our social framework; freeing ourselves from its grips requires a lot of effort in a lot of different arenas. Recycling is one positive practice in a fabric of environmental advocacy.

Allow me to follow Tierney's lead and wax psychoanalytical for a moment. Tierney suspects that recycling advocates are spurred by environmental zealotry rather than genuine concern for resource efficiency. I suspect that recycling deniers are spurred by laziness rather than economics. Recycling takes effort, and its benefits show up only at a distance from the point at which one decides what to do with an empty bottle. If one isn't motivated by the "warm glow" recycling can provide, then it's immensely easy to toss the bottle into a wastebasket. It is made even easier by the fact that we are still able to ignore the more obvious effects of increasing landfill waste. Most people are fortunate enough that they don't have to be reminded of how gross our waste is on a daily basis. But that doesn't mean the effects aren't there or that they aren't going to impact society at large eventually. 

We're all subject to filtering out certain considerations from our cost-benefit analysis. But weighing the annoyance of properly sorting recyclables higher than the environmental impact of landfilling waste is not sound economics. It is [hyperbolic discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting) combined with a lack concern for the impact of our actions beyond our own small sphere.

Any major social practice, recycling included, should be put under the microscope to determine ways we can improve it to better meet our shared goals. But in doing so, it's important to judge the practice fairly, and on the basis of effects that are central to it. The process is hard. Not only is it difficult to determine what practices are responsible for different effects, but examining our practices leads us to realize that things are much more interdependent than we may have originally thought. Recycling alone won't get us there, but the balance of evidence suggests it is a vital piece of the puzzle.
