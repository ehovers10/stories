As only the 5th papal visit to the US, Pope Francis' trip through Washington DC, New York, and Philadelphia this week is naturally an exciting event. 

At Big Reuse, we're especially excited because of Pope Francis' dedication to environmentalism. The Pope's recent encyclical, *Laudato Si'* ("Be Praised"), is addressed to all humankind as a proposal to open a dialogue about human impact on the environment. He calls for an *integral ecology*, one that recognizes the importance of environmental concerns to both humanity's physical and spiritual health. Its primary theme is our shared responsibility to care for our common home.

*Laudato Si'* addresses a number of environmental and social concerns ranging from climate change and loss of biodiversity to inequitable distribution of energy resources. Francis approaches these issues from both a scientific and a spiritual perspective. An overarching concern that he points to is what he calls the *rapidification* of the pace life. 

> "Although change is part of the working of complex systems, the speed with which human activity has developed contrasts with the naturally slow pace of biological evolution. Moreover, the goals of this rapid and constant change are not necessarily geared to the common good or to integral and sustainable human development. Change is something desirable, yet it becomes a source of anxiety when it causes harm to the world and to the quality of life of much of humanity." (*Laudato Si'*, sect. 18)

We'd like to echo the Pope's sentiment on sustainable human development. We encourage the development of new technologies for facilitating human health and equality, and we're happy when such changes bring economic benefit in their wake. But in the constant push for progess, it's easy to lose track of the goal, which is not advancement itself but the improvement of life for all of humanity. Sometimes the best way to do that is to slow down and make complete use of the resources we already have.

With our salvage and reuse efforts, we like to think that we play a small but important role in this effort. Over-consumption is a big problem that leads to undermined ecosystems, overflowing waste streams, and widened quality of life disparities. Many wonderful treasures hit NYC landfills when they still have functional life left in them. By seeking these out and finding them new homes, we can do a little bit to lessen our impact on the environment.

It's naive to think that a single person, or even a single non-profit, can solve the issues facing our common home. We need large scale shifts in the social paradigm. But, as Francis writes:
  
> "Liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm does in fact happen sometimes, for example, when cooperatives of small producers adopt less polluting means of production, and opt for a non-consumerist model of life, recreation and community... Or indeed when the desire to create and contemplate beauty manages to overcome reductionism through a kind of salvation which occurs in beauty and in those who behold it." (*Laudato Si'*, sect. 112). 

It can happen from the ground up. Individual efforts do make a difference, and combined efforts are more powerful than the sum of their individual parts. We wish to thank all the donors, volunteers, and customers that have helped Big Reuse's efforts in landfill diversion. And we want to thank Pope Francis for bringing a wider audience to the dialogue on environmentalism.
