As only the 5th papal visit to the US, Pope Francis' trip through Washington DC, New York, and Philadelphia this week is naturally an exciting event. 

At Big Reuse, we're especially excited because of Pope Francis' dedication to environmentalism. The Pope's recent encyclical, *Laudato Si'* ("Be Praised"), is addressed to all humankind as a proposal to open a dialogue about human impact on the environment. He calls for an *integral ecology*, one that recognizes the importance of environmental concerns to both humanity's physical and spiritual health. Its primary theme is our shared responsibility to care for our common home.

*Laudato Si'* addresses a number of environmental and social concerns ranging from climate change and loss of biodiversity to inequitable distribution of energy resources. Francis approaches these issues from both a scientific and a spiritual perspective. An overarching concern that he points to is what he calls the *rapidification* of the pace life. 

> "Although change is part of the working of complex systems, the speed with which human activity has developed contrasts with the naturally slow pace of biological evolution. Moreover, the goals of this rapid and constant change are not necessarily geared to the common good or to integral and sustainable human development. Change is something desirable, yet it becomes a source of anxiety when it causes harm to the world and to the quality of life of much of humanity." (*Laudato Si'*, sect. 18)

We'd like to echo the Pope's sentiment on sustainable human development. We encourage the development of new technologies for facilitating human health and equality, and we're happy when such changes bring economic benefit in their wake. But in the constant push for progess, it's easy to lose track of the goal, which is not advancement itself but the improvement of life for all of humanity. Sometimes the best way to do that is to slow down and make complete use of the resources we already have.

With our salvage and reuse efforts, we like to think that we play a small but important role in this effort. Over-consumption is a big problem that leads to undermined ecosystems, overflowing waste streams, and widened quality of life disparities. Many wonderful treasures hit NYC landfills when they still have functional life left in them. By seeking these out and finding them new homes, we can do a little bit to lessen our impact on the environment.

It's naive to think that a single person, or even a single non-profit, can solve the issues facing our common home. We need large scale shifts in the social paradigm. But, as Francis writes:
  
> "Liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm does in fact happen sometimes, for example, when cooperatives of small producers adopt less polluting means of production, and opt for a non-consumerist model of life, recreation and community... Or indeed when the desire to create and contemplate beauty manages to overcome reductionism through a kind of salvation which occurs in beauty and in those who behold it." (*Laudato Si'*, sect. 112). 

It can happen from the ground up. Individual efforts do make a difference, and combined efforts are more powerful than the sum of their individual parts. We wish to thank all the donors, volunteers, and customers that have helped Big Reuse's efforts in landfill diversion. And we want to thank Pope Francis for bringing a wider audience to the dialogue on environmentalism.

## Intro

> "I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. The worldwide ecological movement has already made considerable progress and led to the establishment of numerous organizations committed to raising awareness of these challenges. Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity." (Sect. 14)

## Chapter 1

The Pope discusses the latest scientific consensus on environmental change. His point is not one of considering all sides to come to a conclusion. We are past that point. The concern now is with drawing gloabl attention to the reality of environmental change and inspiring a corresponding change in human behavior.

> "Following a period of irrational confidence in progress and human abilities, some sectors of society are now adopting a more critical approach. We see increasing sensitivity to the environment and the need to protect nature, along with a growing concern, both genuine and distressing, for what is happening to our planet. Let us review, however cursorily, those questions which are troubling us today and which we can no longer sweep under the carpet. Our goal is not to amass information or to satisfy curiosity, but rather to become painfully aware, to dare to turn what is happening to the world into our own personal suffering and thus to discover what each of us can do about it." (Sect. 19)

> "The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life. A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it. It is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth’s orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity. As these gases build up in the atmosphere, they hamper the escape of heat produced by sunlight at the earth’s surface. The problem is aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system. Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes." (Sect. 23)
