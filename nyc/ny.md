You lose somsething when you go to New York.  And, it's not them.  Each person in New York is pretty harmless; it's just that there are so many of them. When you get so many people together in the same place, they forget. They forget about space and property and comfort. To where they can't differentiate from their own lack of thsoe things and anyone else's. But they aren't bad. THey'll tell you that you just have to "make it". That eventually, you'll come to work within the system that is New York. But it's a shit system. And the funny thing is that there is an alternative; an alternative that so many other people have already figured out is way better than what is on offer in New York. It's buolt up an amazing PR record; like it's *the* place to be. But it's not. It's not even that bad of a place; it's just not that good either.
