In time he found the trinket dangling from a spider thread, itself reinforced with twenty buttresses justting out at haphazard angles. Some were anchored to the nearby eave, others traversed great distances to alight, slide, and stick to the downspout. One intrepid explorer has crossed the chasm into the animate and was tethered to a lilac branch, softly swaying to and fro, east and west. Xylem up and phloem down.

The strength of spider silk is widely touted, and sure, strength is a nice perk if you can get it. But flexibility will get you into more joints and past bigger bouncers. There's always a bouncer bigger than you. And don't knock tackiness! You can find a million reasons to head off on another adventure. The power to stick around is what lets you really get to know a place.

That aforementioned arachnal secretion has tackiness in spades. This particular thread, a remnant of what appeared to have once been a sizeable mansion by the standards of the creepu and crawly, had stuck around for quite some time. Its original architect was nowhere to be found, and by the looks of the slapshod remodel, it's not clear she would have enjoyed a homecoming.

An elephant never forgets, but she's quick to forgive. A spider constantly has a full docket repairing carelessly snapped moorings and would rather not spend what little free time she has mending fences with simple minded feather dusters hellbent on destroying something beautiful. If time is the great healer, then time isn't made of spider silk. It takes a lot of energy to weave a web, carefully mapping out the minor-ampullate, designing the major-ampullate structure to accommodate the dominant winds, and securing it all together with just enough pyriform. It takes even more energy to maintain. Strong as each strand is, they all have weak points and demand constant monitoring. When a mindless hiker severs a two meter dragline with his face and hautily flings it aside with a sputter of disgust, it's enough to make all eight of a spider's eyes see red.

But back to the trinket. "Trinket" is a perfectly fitting term. It wasn't of particular value, not had it been missing long enough for time's rubbing compound to smooth out its imperfections in anyone's mind. Still, it had been given to him by a one time friend, someone he had no hard feelings toward now, and enough welcome memories ignited by the trinket to raise the corners of his mouth when he spotted it.

The trinket, by the way, was a mood ring. The idea behind mood jewelry had always confounded, and often dismayed, him. Why would someone want their innermost feelings diplayed to the world? And in such a hideous way, too! Mood jewlery always resembled a glob of hardened snot, or an especially concerning boil emerging from one's finger.

It was hard enough to keep one's facial features from revealing the pain caused by every thoughtless slight, or the unbecoming glee brought on by the simplest recognition. Why would anyone announce so boldly the inner battle between delirium and depression. Unless, as he had always suspected, the mood ring was genuinely meant as a shield, used to deflect any serious investigation into one's person. A decoy emotion that the wearer hoped would sate an inquirer until the socially required feigned interest ran its course.
