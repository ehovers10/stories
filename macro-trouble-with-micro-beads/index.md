Micro-beads are the little plastic balls used as exfoliants in a variety of skin and tooth care products. They are the state of the art in clear complexion, but they aren't clearing the city sewer system. They're everywhere, and they aren't going anywhere.

The problem with micro-beads is one of size and quantity. The beads are too small to be caught by filters in most wastewater treatment plants. As a result, they head down the shower drain and find their way into natural waterways. And the beads are found by the hundred thousand in a wide variety of cosmetic products. It is estimated that in New York alone, 19 tons of micro-beads enter the ecosystem every year.

The true abrasize quality of microbeads rears its head once they enter natural waterways. Fish and other aquatic life mistake the beads for food, and the beads wreak havoc on their system, lacerating the digestive tract and causing liver toxicity. The harm doesn't stop with the animals. Once in the food chain, the beads stick around for years, eventually making their way onto the plates of human diners.

Beyond the direct physical harm the gritty beads can cause, there is a general environmental concern of pumping all this plasic into the water. The plastic sticks around for years -- even so-called biodegradeable plasics break down very slowly in an aquatic environment. And they don't benignly settle to the sea floor to await decomposition. Many of the chemicals associated with microplastic are "priority pollutants under the US EPA Clean Water Act for being persistent, bioacummulative and/or toxic" ([Society for Conservation Biology report](https://conbio.org/images/content_policy/03.24.15_Microbead_Brief_Statement.pdf)). 

Micro-beads are a major problem, and they're completely unnecessary. Safe alternatives to the cosmetic additives exist. While the New York State Senate failed to pass the Microbead-Free Waters Act, a number of local communities have taken up the slack, with [Erie, Chautauqua, and Suffolk counties](http://www.fox5ny.com/news/local-news/39637846-story) leading the way.

The New York City Council is currently considering a ban in NYC, and you have an opportunity to let them know how important this is. The Wildlife Conservation Society has made it easy to [send a message to City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito](https://secure3.convio.net/wcs/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=773). Speak up on this important issue today!
