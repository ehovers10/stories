At Big Reuse, we love going above and beyond to give old things new life. But even we realize that there comes a time to let some things fall into permanent retirement. Such a time has arrived for many coal power plants throughout New York. One of the worst polluters in New York, the Huntley coal plant in Tonawanda, will be [shutting its turbines down for good](http://www.investigativepost.org/2015/08/25/nrg-to-retire-huntley-coal-plant-in-tonawanda/) by March 2016.
 
Coal burning is responsible for [30 percent of all carbon dioxide pollution](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/The-case-against-coal/) in the US. And its environmental impact isn't all up in the air. Waste from coal combustion in the US, most of which ends up in landfills, amounts to [130 million tons a year](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/coal/Power-plant-waste/) -- equivalent to all the household solid waste Americans produce!
 
We agree with President Obama that "[Climate change is not a problem for another generation, not anymore.](https://www.whitehouse.gov//climate-change)" It's no longer feasible to deny the environmental impact of fossil fuel burning, and it's time to push forward on a transition to greener, more renewable energy sources. The newly announced Clean Power Plan pushes states to change their energy consumption habits, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels within 10 years. By incorporating renewable energy and conservation practices into state energy portfolios, we can effectively end our reliance on coal.
 
Any transition of this magnitude will come with difficulties. Coal power plants provide jobs in a number of communities throughout New York. In recognition of this, state legislators have [set aside $19 million](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/06/8571087/state-deal-includes-funding-ease-coal-plant-closing) to help ease the burden on these communities through the transition. Luckily, other, cleaner options exist. While the coal industry lost 49,000 jobs nationally last year, the [solar and wind industry gained 79,000 jobs](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/08/06/obama-leaves-coal-with-nowhere/pVWWn4DWb9oCsrddwiWxUI/story.html). With the plummeting cost of solar and wind and improvements to infrastructure such as transmission lines, renewable energy is more cost effective than fossil fuels. When we include the true cost of coal to the environment, it becomes clear that we cannot retire coal quickly enough.
 
New Yorkers have always been leaders in social change, and we have a great opportunity to lead the nation into a cleaner future. If you support the transition away from reliance on coal, [let Governor Cuomo know](https://secure.sierraclub.org/site/Advocacy;jsessionid=5CED954EB4DF520E30F413C6974FBC02.app234a?pagename=homepage&page=UserAction&id=16425&autologin=true&s-src=215JCOAE06), and push him to avoid bailing out past-their-prime coal plants.
